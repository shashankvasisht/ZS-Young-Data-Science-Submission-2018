* All the code and supporting files are kept in the Section_C subfolder of the   yds_submission folder.

* The yds_submission.csv is present in the Section_B subfolder and the approach     presentation is kept in the Section_A subfolder.

* To generate the yds_submission2018.csv and to get the predictions open the   "Predictions_Linear_Regression.ipynb" file in jupyter notebook and run each block of   it. After all blocks are run, a yds_submission2018.csv file will be created in the same directory as that of the code.

* In case the .ipynb notebook does not run, a "Predictions_Linear_Regression.py" file is present too. Simply run this file in any python IDLE and it shall generate the same csv file.

* To predict on a different dataset simply put the csv file in the same directory and change the name of the csv file in the "pd.read_csv('new_csv')" command in the prediction file.

* The training and dataset cleaning files are all kept in Section_C subfolder.
